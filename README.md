### Greg's personal GitHub

I write a lot of code as part of my job. But the code here is stuff I've written on my own.

[An online version of my resume is available here.](https://github.com/gregorykemp/gregorykemp/blob/main/gkemp_resume_2022.md) 

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some stock-market analysis tools in Python.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that stock-market analysis in Python is harder than I anticipated.
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about design verification, computer architecture, engineering management, and the stock market.
* ðŸ“« How to reach me: options below.
* ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his.
* âš¡ Fun fact: I keep a small koi pond, which can be challenging in the Texas heat.

I'm also the webmaster behind [my wife's blog about being an aneurysm survivor.](https://livedtotell.org/)


### Respositories

[UVM Testbench](https://github.com/gregorykemp/sample_uvm_testbench) is a small testbench I wrote to demonstrate my SystemVerilog and UVM knowledge. It's nothing fancy, but it is complete. It exercises the integer multiply and divide unit from a sample RISC-V processor, written in Verilog. The repo includes directions on running the code on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)

Stonks is an attempt to do automatic stock fundamental analysis, with the hope of finding investment opportunities. The name plays off the [Internet meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stonks).
